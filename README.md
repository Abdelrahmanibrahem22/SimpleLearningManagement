# SimpleLearningManagement
Project Introduction:
This project requires you to create a "Simple Learning Management System" console application using Java programming language.

A learning management system (LMS) is a software application or web-based technology used to plan, implement and assess a specific learning process. It is used for eLearning practices and, in its most common form, consists of two elements: a server that performs the base functionality and a user interface that is operated by instructors, students, and administrators.

In this project, you are required to create a console application for the system administrator using Java programming language.
